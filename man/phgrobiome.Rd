\title{Extract physiological parameters from kinetic pH and OD600 data using multiple strains and complex carbon sources}
\usage{
phgrobiome(data, metadata, unique_graphs = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{This is the input data that has been loaded into r that you would like to model. It is a tidy dataframe containing a column for Sample.ID, OD600,pH, and time. This will most often be the output off phgropro.}

\item{metadata}{This is the metadata that has been previously loaded into r}
}
\value{
A tidy data frame of 8 values extracted from the spline interpolation.If graphs > 0 then x number of randomly sampled graphs are generated displaying the model fit and relevant parameters.
\itemize{
 \item{"u1"}{ max growth rate during LEX1.}
 \item{"u2"}{ max growth rate during LEX2}
 \item{"RAc"}{ max rate of acidification during LEX1}
 \item{"RBa"}{ max rate of basification during LEX2}
 \item{"LLP_length"}{ length of lag phase}
 \item{"LEX1_length"}{ length of first growth phase}
 \item{"LTP_length "}{ length of transition phase}
 \item{"LEX2_length"}{ length of 2nd growth phase occuring durring the basification.}

\description{
phgrofit takes pH and OD600 data that has been formated by phgropro and applies a spline interpolation to extract relevant physiological data.
