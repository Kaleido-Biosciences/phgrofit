\title{phgrofit: Extract physiological parameters from kinetic pH and OD600 data}
\usage{
phgrofit(data, metadata)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{This is the input data that you would like to model. It is a tidy dataframe containing a column for Sample.ID, OD600,pH, and time. This will most often be the output off phgropro.}

\item{graphs}{This is the number specifying how many graphs you would like to print to console. This is useful for visually inspecting the modeling.}
}
\value{
A tidy data frame of 8 values extracted from the spline interpolation.If graphs > 0 then x number of randomly sampled graphs are generated displaying the model fit and relevant parameters.
\itemize{
 \item{"u1"}{ max growth rate during LEX1.}
 \item{"u2"}{ max growth rate during LEX2}
 \item{"RAc"}{ max rate of acidification during LEX1}
 \item{"RBa"}{ max rate of basification during LEX2}
 \item{"LLP_length"}{ length of lag phase}
 \item{"LEX1_length"}{ length of first growth phase}
 \item{"LTP_length "}{ length of transition phase}
 \item{"LEX2_length"}{ length of 2nd growth phase occuring durring the basification.}

\description{
phgrofit takes pH and OD600 data that has been formated by phgropro and applies a spline interpolation to extract relevant physiological data.
This function was created to replicate the work done in Heux Et Al. It may not be the most appropriate for analyzing microbiome data.
For microbiome data, it is suggested to use the phgrobiome function.
}
\examples{
### When we want 10 random graphs to be generated from a tidy data frame named data.
phgrofit(data, graphs = 10)
}
