}
\arguments{
\item{biotek_export}{.txt file that results from a specific format of exporting data from the Biotek Gen5 software.}

\item{metadata}{.csv file that contains information about the contents of the samples. Must contain a column called Sample.ID.}

\item{Plate_Type}{96 or 384 specifying which plate type was ran on the plate reader.}
}
\value{
tidy data frame with a column for Sample ID, any metadata columns present,Time, OD600, and pH.
}
\description{
phgropro- pH growh processing- takes the export from a standardized biotek plate reader and converts it into a tidy format that is convenient for data analysis. This tidy format will oftern serve as the input to phgrofit.

\examples{
### When we want to extract the data from from a 96 well plate run on the plate reader.
output_96 = phgropro(biotek_export = filepath.txt,metadata = metadata.csv,Plate_Type = 96)

### When we want to extract the data from from a 384 well plate run on the plate reader.
output_384 = phgropro(biotek_export = filepath.txt,metadata = metadata.csv,Plate_Type = 384)
